# Basic Sentiment Analysis

## Overview

This project implements a **Basic Sentiment Analysis** model designed to preprocess and classify text data. It transforms raw text into a clean format before applying sentiment classification techniques to label data as *positive* or *negative*.

## Key Features

- **Text Preprocessing**:
  - Expands contractions (e.g., "isn't" â†’ "is not")
  - Removes HTML tags, emojis, and special characters
  - Applies tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal
  - Cleans and normalizes text by converting it to lowercase and removing punctuation

- **Sentiment Classification**: The model predicts sentiment polarity (positive/negative) after text preprocessing.

## Dependencies

To run this notebook, the following libraries are required:

- `nltk` for natural language processing tasks (lemmatization, stopwords)
- `beautifulsoup4` for HTML tag removal
- `contractions` for expanding contractions in text
- `re`, `string` for regular expressions and punctuation handling

## Installation

Use the following commands to install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install nltk
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install contractions
```

## Usage
- **Text Preprocessing**:

The preprocess_text() function applies several steps such as cleaning HTML, removing emojis, and lemmatizing words.
Example:
```bash
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import nltk
import re
import string
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')

def preprocess_text(text):
    # Clean and preprocess text
    soup = BeautifulSoup(text, "html.parser")
    text = soup.get_text()
    text = re.sub(r'http\S+', '', text)  # Remove URLs
    text = "".join([char.lower() for char in text if char not in string.punctuation])
    return text

cleaned_text = preprocess_text("I love this movie! ðŸ˜Š It's absolutely amazing!")
print(cleaned_text)  # Output: "i love this movie its absolutely amazing"
```

- **Sentiment Classification**: After preprocessing, the cleaned text is passed to a classification model to predict whether the sentiment is positive or negative.

## Example Dataset
The notebook uses a dataset where each text entry is labeled with either positive or negative sentiment. The dataset is first preprocessed, and then the cleaned text is used to train or test the model.
